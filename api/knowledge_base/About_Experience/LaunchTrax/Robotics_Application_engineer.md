# Robotics Application Engineer

**Employer:** Launchtrax Pvt. Limited, Bangalore, India  
**Client:** DRDO & Hindustan Aeronautics Limited  
**Duration:** Feb 2020 - July 2024

## Responsibilities  
- Processed LiDAR DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) with GRASS GIS and GDAL, automating flood-risk mapping using Python and scikit-learn clustering algorithms for disaster-response missions.  
- Engineered a Dask-parallelized pipeline for SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data processing, reducing latency by 55% in real-time disaster-response workflows.  
- Deployed OpenVINO-optimized YOLOv5 on an Intel NUC for real-time aerial object detection, achieving 45 FPS on Hikvision thermal cameras during surveillance operations.  
- Developed a CANopen stack with Socket CAN on Raspberry Pi 4, enabling real-time communication between UAV payloads and Pixhawk flight controllers.  
- Streamlined a GIS framework to de-clutter aeronautical map elements by 50%, enabling dynamic manipulation and attribute clarity at various zoom levels with GeoServer, HTML, C++, and QGIS—enhancing user interpretability by 30%.  
- Designed algorithmic trajectory planners in C++, reducing UAV fuel consumption by 22% for long-range surveillance missions over mountainous terrain.  
- Streamlined QGIS workflows with PostgreSQL and GeoServer, dynamically rendering aeronautical charts at 10,000:1 scale for defense and aviation clients.  
- Developed and optimized geo-pointing & geo-location algorithms in Python, leveraging OpenCV and GDAL to convert UAV camera feeds from image coordinates to world coordinates via a GUI—improving navigational accuracy by 40%.  
- Authored System Requirements Specifications (SRS), Acceptance Test Procedures (ATP), and user manuals using LaTeX and Sphinx, coordinating with four departments and a five-official review panel.  
- Developed STM32-based motor controllers with FreeRTOS and TMC2209 drivers for 0.1° UAV gimbal stabilization in aerial photogrammetry, and implemented Model Predictive Control (MPC) in MATLAB/Simulink for trajectory tracking—cutting tracking error by 18%.
