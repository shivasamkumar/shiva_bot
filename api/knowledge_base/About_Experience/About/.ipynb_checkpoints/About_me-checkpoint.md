# About Me
I’m **Shiva**, a robotics and autonomous systems engineer with over 3 years of professional experience solving complex technical challenges. My fascination with the way machines move and perceive their environment led me to pursue a Master’s in Robotics and Automation at Arizona State University. There, I deepened my understanding of robot kinematics, control system design, and multi-modal sensor fusion.

Throughout my career, I’ve designed and implemented end-to-end autonomy pipelines—from low-level motion controllers and Kalman filters to high-level navigation stacks and SLAM algorithms. I thrive on integrating AI and deep-learning techniques (computer vision, language models) into robotics to enable smarter, more adaptive behaviors. My hands-on work spans:

- **Autonomous Navigation & SLAM**: Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization, Nav2, twist_mux arbitration, multi-robot coordination  
- **Control & Estimation**: Differential-drive and multirobot path planners; Extended and Linear Kalman Filters; model predictive control  
- **Perception & AI Integration**: YOLO-based vision pipelines; RAG-powered QA systems; SegFormer and CLIPSeg for semantic segmentation; GPT-driven advisory tools  
- **Full-Stack Robotics Development**: ROS/ROS 2, Gazebo, MoveIt, Carla, PlotJuggler; Python, C++, MATLAB; hardware interfaces (Arduino, serial comms)

I’ve collaborated across multidisciplinary teams—mechanical designers, software architects, data scientists—to deliver robust prototypes under tight deadlines (e.g., 48-hour hackathons, semester-long capstone projects). My background in project management, GIS integration, and cross-functional communication ensures that complex systems are not only technically sound but also aligned with stakeholder needs.

Beyond technical work, I’m a motivated team player who actively contributes to community and student-led initiatives. I’ve both organized and participated in hackathons, volunteered at blood-donation camps and flood-relief fundraisers, and conducted hands-on workshops for junior students—sharing foundational robotics and coding knowledge to inspire the next generation of engineers.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I’m constantly exploring new paradigms in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning for robotics, and human-robot interaction. My goal is to step into a Robotics Design Engineer role where I can architect innovative automation solutions, mentor junior engineers, and contribute to next-generation autonomous platforms.
