Abstract.  The  Piston  is  meant  to  be  the  maximum  load  withstanding  structure  in  an
internal combustion engine. The Piston of an IC engine is assigned to transform thermal
energy into mechanical energy by expanding gases and to sustain for a longer period. To
increase the lifetime and thermal resistance of the piston, the material should have higher
strength to density ratio and lower coefficient of thermal expansion. Thus, the study of
reinforced Aluminum metal (A2024 alloy) as a frame and organic compound (fly ash) as
a filler or matrix (metal matrix or hybrid composites), which has higher strength to weight
ratio  is  done  and      this  paper  deals  with  the  determination  and  study  of  structural  and
thermal  stress  distribution  on  Piston  made  of  Aluminum  Matrix  Composite.  A  piston
model is prepared in CATIA V5R20 (Modelling software) and the properties is examined
using CAE software (ANSYS).Keywords: AMCs, A2024, engine, energy, Ansys

1.   INTRODUCTION
Piston is the most crucial part in an engine. The advancement and development in the material
selection geometry and manufacturing have been drastically increasing from past few years. The
purpose of piston in an internal combustion engine is to transfer the maximum amount of force
extracted from the expanding of gases in the cylinder to the crank shaft through the connecting
rod  [3,6].  A  piston  engine  is  said  to  be  sustainable  and  efficient  if  the  piston  is  capable  of
transferring the maximum amount of force extracted from expanding of gases in the cylinder to
the  crank  shaft  with  in  a  suitable  short  period  of  time  and do  the same for a longer run  with
minimal  wear  and  tear  and  minimal  deformation.  In  this  research,  a  piston  is  made  up  of
Aluminum  metal  matrix  (light  weight  metal  matrix)  [1,2,4].  Essential  and  increasing
advancement in the development of light metal composite framework has been attained in the last
decades and thus the advancements could be introduced into most of the industrial applications.
Metal matrix (MMC’s has been utilized monetarily as reinforced piston [7-9].

Thus, the study of reinforced Aluminum metal (A2024 alloy) as a frame and organic compound
(fly ash) as a filler or matrix (metal matrix or hybrid composites) which has higher strength- to-
weight ratio and high stress withstanding structure [5,10]. This paper deals with the determination
and study of temperature distribution, structural and thermal stress distribution on piston made of
Aluminum matrix composite.

2.   MATERIAL SELECTION
The composite material is fabricated by stir casting method with Aluminum 2024 (A2024) alloy
as a reinforcement  metal  and  fly  ash  (organic  compounds)  as  filler  or  matrix.  Stir  casting
is  the  method  of fabricating composite material in liquid state, where the dispersed phase is
mixed with the matrix metal (molten state) by means of mechanical stirring. Aluminum matrix
composites have strength and are highly ductile. The properties of metal matrix composite has
been tabulated down in Table 1 .



3.   DESIGN OF PISTON
A prototype of piston is designed in CATIA V5R20 modelling software as it an easy modelling
tool in which files can be easily exported to any analysis software in igs format. Figure 1. shows
the front view of the piston with dimensions whereas Figure 2. demonstrates the isometric view
of piston model in CATIA V5 R20 modeling software.

4.3 BOUNDARY CONDITION
The surface of the piston and piston pin hole are subjected to frictionless support. When a face is
subjected to frictionless support, the transitional and rotational motion normal to the face is
locked. In this paper, we consider the effect of side thrust face to be negligible but in reality, it has
some impact on deformation and stress on the piston surface, but pressure forces are taken in
record and uniform temperature is maintained throughout the analysis. 9Mpa of force is applied
on the piston crown as shown in the figure 5.

4.4 THERMAL ANALYSIS
Thermal  analysis  of  Aluminum  matrix  piston  is  done  in  ANSYS  to  find  the  suitability  at
maximum temperature. The maximum and minimum temperature values are set as 1500ºC and

22ºC respectively and convection film coefficient of 1.2 *

 is applied.

coefficient

4.5 THERMAL STRESS
A hollow circular cylinder of some cross section as metal  matrix composite piston is modelled
with  10mm  depth.  Thermal  stress  analysis  is  done  in  static  structural  solver  by  applying  the
boundary conditions on inner and  outer  face  of  cylinder  as  200ºC  and  300ºC  respectively.  The
outer  face  of  the  cylinder  is  locked  to  6 degrees of freedom and a pressure load of 500Mpa is
applied on the inner wall of piston. The figure 8. shows the boundary and loading conditions over
the aluminum metal matrix composites.



5.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSONS
5.1 STATIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

The static structural analysis is used to find out the total deformation, von misses, stresses and
strains.  The  static  analysis  of  Aluminum  matrix  piston  is  done  by  ANSYS  software  for  the
combustion pressure of 9Mpa. The results of total deformation, equivalent stress and elastic strain
has been shown from Figure 9-11.
The  maximum  deflection  induced  in  the  piston  is  at  top  of  the  piston.  The  maximum  von
misses  stress is developed in the inner boss fillet area which is due to the concentrated stress and
application of pressure on the top surface of the piston. The maximum stress is visualized at the
inner side of the piston pin boss fillet area. The results of total deformation, equivalent stress,
equivalent strain has been tabulated in Table 2.



5.2 THERMAL ANALYSIS
Transient  thermal,  steady-state  thermal  and  static  structural  solver  of  ANSYS  workbench  is
chosen for  thermal  analysis  of  metal  matrix  composite  piston.  The  Figure  12-  14  displays  the
result of temperature distribution, thermal stress and total heat flux generated in aluminum metal
matrix composite piston.
Figure 13. shows the total heat flux generation on the metal matrix composite piston under the
given temperatures. The maximum heat flux region is on the interior region of the piston and is
not accessible which shows that the restriction of thermal stress is also not accessible and thus the
material is safe. The results of thermal stress, total heat flux has been tabulated in Table 3.


6.   CONCLUSION
Thus,  the  result  of  thermal  and  structural  analysis  of  Aluminum  matrix  composite  piston  is
interpreted and studied and it is proven that Aluminum matrix composite piston with A2024 as
reinforcement metal and fly ash (organic compound) as filler or matrix is light weight structure,
has a high tensile strength and also has a high- pressure withstanding structure. Aluminum matrix
composite (A2024 + fly ash) piston have a greater strength and the structure is highly ductile, thus
the heat energy is easily transformed to mechanical energy. As the maximum heat flux generated
in  the  piston  is  inaccessible,  it  says  that  the  piston  is  safe  throughout  the  combustion  and
sustainable.  The  deformation  in  the  piston  due  to  application  of  heavy  pressure  load  is  very
minimum  and  negligible.    Hence,  in  this  research  paper  it  is  proven  that  the  metal  matrix
composite can be used in  industrial  applications  especially  in  automobile  industries  cause  of
its  unique  structural  and  thermal properties.
