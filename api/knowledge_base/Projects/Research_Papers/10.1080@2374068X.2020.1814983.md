## ABSTRACT
Gears are the most important and critical component in automotive
and  power  transmission  systems.  They  are  the  small  machine  ele-
ments which are used to transmit power and motion between the
shafts  by  means  of  repetitive  arrangements  in  the  form  of  projec-
tions. The advancement in the transmission made the gears as one
of  the  most  predominating  and  effective  means  of  transmitting
power in future due to the degree of dependency and compatibil-
ity.  The best  spur gear design should be easy to manufacture and
should be of less weight. Thus, the study of aluminium metal matrix
composites  with  Al  2024  as  matrix  metal  and  organic  compound
(fly ash) as reinforcement which has higher strength to weight ratio
is  done  and  this  paper  deals  with  the  determination  and  study  of
stress distribution on spur gear made up of aluminium metal matrix
composite. A spur gear model is designed mathematically accord-
ing  to  the  standard  design  procedure  and  modelled  in  CATIA  V5
R20  (modelling  software)  and  the  properties  are  examined  using
CAE software (ANSYS).

## 1. Introduction

Gears are one of the most critical components in automotive power transmitting system
and in most industrial machining. The advancement in the gear technology may lead to
the most predominating structure in the automotive industry for being the most efficient
and effective means of transmitting power in future machines due to their high degree of
reliability  and  compatibility.  Gears  are  small  circular  plates  with  teeth-like  projections
which  transmit  power  motion  between  the  shafts  by  meshing  without  slipping  of  the
surface.  One  gear  is  called  the  driving  gear  and  the  other  is  called  as  driven  gear.  The
increasing demand for structures which are capable of performing quite heavier power
transmission  in  vehicles,  elevators  and  generators  has  to  be  created  a  need  for  a  more
precise  validation  of  the  properties  of  the  gear  systems  [1,2].  Composites  play  an
interesting  role  in  the  field  of  automotives  because  they  have  better  mechanical  char-
acteristics  which  include  wear  resistance,  corrosion  resistance,  lubricant  free,  produce
less noise and have high strength to weight ratio. The advancement in the composites has
led to metal matrix composite which has been in use from 1960’s.


The power transmission error is usually due to two main factors. One among them can
be said as the manufacturing inaccuracy and errors. This error can be often compensated
by  modifying  the  gear  teeth.  The  other  error  is  caused  due  to  elastic  deflection  under
conditions  such  as  loading.  One  of  the  errors  which  is  difficult  to  control  is  the  noise
generated  at  the  tooth  mesh  frequency  [3,4].  Transmission  error  is  considered  as  the
main contribution to the noise and vibration in a gear set. Even though the transmission
error is relatively small, this slight variation can cause noise at frequency which matches
the resonance of the gear housing, causing the increase in noise. This phenomenon has
been actively studied to minimise the amount of error caused by transmission in gears.
Since gears are generally used under various sets of speeds and loading conditions, the
composite  materials  are  included  in  design  cause  of  numerous  advantages  such  as
resistance  to  corrosion,  ease  of  mass  production  and  implicit  ability  to  work  without
external lubrication [5,6].

Thus,  the  study  of  Aluminium  Metal  Matrix  Composite  (AMMCs)  the  aluminium
which is in its alloy forms a pre – locating network and is in the matrix phase and the
other constituent, which is embedded or in-built in the matrix phase known as reinforce-
ment, which has a higher strength to weight ratio and high stress withstanding capability
is performed. The reinforcement is usually preferred to be ceramic. This paper deals with
the design of aluminium metal matrix composite spur gear according to standard design
procedure and validating the structural behaviour against the applied moment/torque.

## 2. Objective

deformation, and weight of the spur gear by using the metal matrix composite material
in the application of gear box.

● To achieve the objective the spur gear should be designed with proper calculations

for the gear teeth, pitch diameter, teeth–separation circumference, etc.

● The  theoretical  design  of  the  spur  gear  is  modelled  in  CATIA  V5  R20

(3-D modelling software)

● The modelled spur gear is validated using CAE tool, ANSYS 16.0 workbench.

## 4. Material selection

The  composite  material  is  fabricated  by  stir  casting  method  with  aluminium  alloy
(A2024)  as  matrix  material  and  fly  ash  as  reinforcement  or  filler.  Stir  casting  is  the
method  of  fabricating  composite  material  in  liquid  state,  where  the  dispersed  phase  is
mixed with matrix metal (molten state) by means of mechanical stirring. A2024 alloy is
highly utilised in automobile applications because of its higher machining characteristics
and higher strength. Tough cold forming is considered as an essential parameter. A2024
is known to be one of the popular alloys for cold heading, thread rolling [7] and can be
essentially  used  in  precision  fittings  and  parts  in  machinery  because  of  their  superior
grain  structure.  There  has  been  n  –  number  of  reinforcements  used  in  composites  of
which  fly  ash  can  be  considered  as  an  important  reinforcement  due  to  its  mechanical
properties such as its low density, improved ultimate tensile strength, toughness, com-
pressive strength, impact strength, and hardness [8]. Aluminium metal matrix compo-
sites have higher strength. The properties of metal matrix composites have been tabulated
in Table 1.

## 5. Structural analysis

Finite  Element  Method  (FEM)  is  widely  used  for  solving  engineering  problems  and
mathematical  models.  It  is  a  particular  numerical  method  used  for  solving  partial
differential  equations  which  consists  of  two  or  three  variables  in  it.  It  is  increasingly
becoming the primary tool for designers and analysts. In this paper we use ANSYS 16.0

workbench  for  validating  the  structural  behaviour  of  the  spur  gear  against  the  torque/
moment  applied  [1,3].  Assumption’s  made  for  calculating  the  load  and  validating  the
stress behaviour of spur gear design is stated as

● The moment load is applied on one face of the driving gear.
● The radial component of the force is neglected so only we calculate the tangential

component of the force [9].

● The moment load is distributed uniformly across the entire face width.
● Forces due to the sliding friction are neglected because of its very small value.
● Stress concentration in the fillet area of the teeth is neglected [10].

With these assumption’s the finite element model for spur gear is modelled in ANSYS
workbench  with  a  medium-sized  mesh  and  fine  mesh  in  the  edges.  The  finite  element
model of the spur gear is discretised into 322,622 nodes and 69,268 elements as shown in
the figure. A moment of 140,000 N-mm and 170,000 N-mm is applied to the front face of
the driving gear in clockwise directions. The centre hole of the driven gear is fixed using
remote displacement support and the hole of the driving gear is fixed using fixed support
and now the finite element models ready for the post-processing. The contours for max
von mises stress, max displacement and von-mises strain is found as shown from Figure
3–5. The maximum von-mises stress in the gear assembly is concentrated in the centre
hole of the pinion gear and contact region between the two gear teeth as shown in Figure
[3]. The total deformation in the spur gear is very low as compared to displacement in the
spur  gear  made  of  cast  steel  [5]  is  also  been  validated  through  the  analytical  values  as
shown in Figure 4. The response and the stress due to the deformation caused in the gear
assembly in response to the torque load of 140 N-m is concentrated in the axle region of
the pinion gear as shown in Figure 5. The experimental results for the spur gear analysis
are tabulated in Table 2.

## 6. Conclusions

The  results  are  studied  and  it  is  seen  that  the  stress  and  displacement  values  for  the
aluminium matrix composite spur gears are minimal. We can see that spur gear model
has  high  load-bearing  capacity  because  of  the  high  strength  to  weight  ratio  of  the
aluminium  metal  matrix  composites  which  also  makes  the  spur  gear  to  be  rigid  and
stiff  because  of  the  displacement  values  0.0005  and  0.0006  under  the  torque  load  of
140  N-m  and  170  N-m  respectively  are  very  minimum  and  negligible.  The  von-mises
stress obtained from the structural analysis (1.8865 MPa) is less than the yield stress of
the metal matrix composite so it is proved that the design is safe and feasible. So, from the

analysis results, we can conclude that, the stress 1.8865 involved in deformation and the
weight of the composite spur gear is less as compared to the materials which are often
used such as cast steel. The structural model which was evaluated using the aluminium
metal matrix composite using computer-aided analysis have been proved to have higher
efficiency and easy manufacturing. The high strength to weight ratio of the metal matrix
makes the spur gear assembly to be light in weight that makes it reliable to be used in




most of the applications such as gear box, power transmission system, etc., in the future
applications of the automotive industry. So, metal matrix composite materials are capable
of using in automobile vehicle gear boxes up to 1.5 KN in the application of Tata super
ace model instead of existing cast steel gears with better results.
